- Detects "Restricted" or "AllSigned" policies and automatically sets to "RemoteSigned" with `-Scope Process`
- Provides user feedback about the policy change
- Includes error handling for cases where policy cannot be modified
- Uses process scope only (temporary, no permanent system changes)

**Benefits:**
- Users with restrictive execution policies can now run the launcher without manual configuration
- Maintains security by only allowing signed scripts while enabling local script execution
- Non-intrusive: changes only apply to the current PowerShell session
- Graceful fallback with clear error messages if policy modification fails

**Technical Details:**
- Checks `Get-ExecutionPolicy` for restrictive policies
- Uses `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force` for temporary elevation
- Process scope ensures changes don't persist beyond the current session
- Added after assembly loading but before global variables section

**Result:** WPF launcher now works out-of-the-box for all users regardless of their execution policy settings, improving user experience and accessibility.

### ✅ Vercel Serverless Function - Custom Domain Working! (Updated 2025-10-24)

**Solution Implemented:** Vercel Serverless Function that serves the installer directly (no redirects!)

**How It Works:**
Instead of redirecting to GitHub (which causes 308 errors), we now use a Vercel serverless function that:
1. Fetches the latest installer from GitHub server-side
2. Serves it directly to PowerShell (no redirect)
3. Always gets the latest version automatically
4. Provides proper error handling

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `api/install.js` - Serverless function that fetches and serves the installer
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Updated to use rewrites instead of redirects

**Working Commands:**

**✅ Method 1: Custom Domain (Now Works Perfectly!)**
```powershell
iwr -useb get.soulitek.co.il | iex
```
- ✅ Short and branded
- ✅ No redirect issues
- ✅ Always latest version
- ✅ Auto-updates on git push
- ✅ Professional custom URL

**✅ Method 2: Direct GitHub URL (Alternative)**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soulitek/Soulitek-All-In-One-Scripts/main/Install-SouliTEK.ps1 | iex
```
- ✅ Direct from source
- ✅ No server dependency

**Result:** 
Both commands now work perfectly! The custom domain command is now just as reliable as the direct GitHub URL, with the added benefit of a shorter, branded URL.

### ✅ Fixed: Event Log Analyzer Invalid Query Error (2025-10-23)

**Problem:** Event Log Analyzer was failing with "The specified query is invalid" error for all Windows Event Logs (Application, System, Security).

**Root Cause:** The XML query construction had a complex nested string interpolation inside the here-string, causing the Level filter portion `($($levels | ForEach-Object { "Level=$_" }) -join ' or ')` to fail during XML parsing.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Separated Level filter construction from XML here-string
- Built $levelFilter variable before XML construction
- Added enhanced error handling with specific catch for "invalid query" errors
- Added verbose logging of actual XML query for debugging
- Removed unused variables ($filterHash, $logInfo)

**Changes Made:**
1. `scripts/EventLogAnalyzer.ps1` - Fixed XML query construction (lines 301-336)
2. `docs/EVENT_ANALYZER_FIX.md` - Created comprehensive fix documentation

### ✅ Fixed: Remote Support Toolkit Terminal Closing Issue (2025-10-23)

**Problem:**

**Root Cause:** 
1. The launcher was starting PowerShell scripts without the `-NoExit` flag, causing the window to close immediately
2. Unicode characters (✓ and •) were causing encoding issues and parser errors on some systems

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified the `Start-Tool` function in `launcher/SouliTEK-Launcher.ps1` to add `-NoExit` flag
- Replaced Unicode checkmarks (✓) with ASCII-safe `[+]` in `scripts/remote_support_toolkit.ps1`
- Replaced bullet points (•) with ASCII hyphens (-) in the same file
- Fixed unused variable warning in the script
- Updated documentation in `docs/GUI_LAUNCHER_GUIDE.md`

**Changes Made:**
1. `launcher/SouliTEK-Launcher.ps1` - Added `-NoExit` flag, removed unused variable
2. `scripts/remote_support_toolkit.ps1` - Fixed encoding issues with special characters, cleaned up unused variables
3. `docs/GUI_LAUNCHER_GUIDE.md` - Updated troubleshooting section with new information

**Result:**

### ✅ Fixed: Event Log Analyzer Invalid Query Error (2025-10-23)

**Problem:** Event Log Analyzer was failing with "The specified query is invalid" error for all Windows Event Logs (Application, System, Security).

**Root Cause:** The XML query construction had a complex nested string interpolation inside the here-string, causing the Level filter portion `($($levels | ForEach-Object { "Level=$_" }) -join ' or ')` to fail during XML parsing.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Separated Level filter construction from XML here-string
- Built $levelFilter variable before XML construction
- Added enhanced error handling with specific catch for "invalid query" errors
- Added verbose logging of actual XML query for debugging
- Removed unused variables ($filterHash, $logInfo)

**Changes Made:**
1. `scripts/EventLogAnalyzer.ps1` - Fixed XML query construction (lines 301-336)
2. `docs/EVENT_ANALYZER_FIX.md` - Created comprehensive fix documentation
3. `workflow_state.md` - Updated with fix progress

**Result:**
- XML query now constructs properly with cleaner code
- Better error messages for troubleshooting
- Verbose mode shows actual query for debugging
- All linter warnings resolved

### ✅ Fixed: Remote Support Toolkit Terminal Closing Issue (2025-10-23)

**Problem:** 
1. When clicking "Launch" on Remote Support Toolkit from the GUI launcher, the terminal window immediately closed
2. Encoding errors with special characters (checkmarks and bullets) causing parser errors

**Root Cause:** 
1. The launcher was starting PowerShell scripts without the `-NoExit` flag, causing the window to close immediately
2. Unicode characters (✓ and •) were causing encoding issues and parser errors on some systems

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified the `Start-Tool` function in `launcher/SouliTEK-Launcher.ps1` to add `-NoExit` flag
- Replaced Unicode checkmarks (✓) with ASCII-safe `[+]` in `scripts/remote_support_toolkit.ps1`
- Replaced bullet points (•) with ASCII hyphens (-) in the same file
- Fixed unused variable warning in the script
- Updated documentation in `docs/GUI_LAUNCHER_GUIDE.md`

**Changes Made:**
1. `launcher/SouliTEK-Launcher.ps1` - Added `-NoExit` flag, removed unused variable
2. `scripts/remote_support_toolkit.ps1` - Fixed encoding issues with special characters, cleaned up unused variables
3. `docs/GUI_LAUNCHER_GUIDE.md` - Updated troubleshooting section with new information

**Result:** 
- PowerShell windows now remain open when launching tools
- No more parser errors from special characters
- Script runs cleanly without encoding issues

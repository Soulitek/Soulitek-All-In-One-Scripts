## Data Interpretation

### Serial Number
- **Unique Identifier**: Each physical USB device has a unique serial number
- **Device Tracking**: Same device will always show the same serial number
- **Multiple Computers**: Track if a device has been used on multiple systems
- **Note**: Some cheap/generic devices may share serial numbers

### VID/PID (Vendor ID / Product ID)
- **VID**: 4-digit hexadecimal code identifying the manufacturer
- **PID**: 4-digit hexadecimal code identifying the specific product model
- **Lookup**: Can be searched in online databases (e.g., devicehunt.com, the-sz.com/products/usbid)
- **Example**: VID_0781 & PID_5567 = SanDisk Cruzer Blade

### Device Status
- **Working Properly**: Device is configured correctly
- **Disabled**: Device has been manually disabled
- **Problem (ConfigFlags: 0xXX)**: Device has configuration issues
- **Unknown**: Status could not be determined

### Last Connected
- **Date/Time**: When the device was last connected (if available)
- **Unknown**: Registry doesn't always store disconnection time
- **Limitation**: Windows doesn't reliably track last connection for all devices
- **Workaround**: Use Event Log analysis for more accurate timestamps

### Install Date
- **First Connection**: Date when device was first installed on the system
- **Driver Installation**: When Windows first configured the device
- **Note**: May differ from first actual use

## Output File Naming

All exported files use the following naming convention:
```
USB_Device_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.[ext]
```

Example:
```
USB_Device_Report_20251023_143025.txt
USB_Device_Report_20251023_143025.csv
USB_Device_Report_20251023_143025.html
```

## Administrator Privileges

### Why Administrator Rights?

The tool requires elevated privileges to:
- Read protected registry keys (HKLM:\SYSTEM)
- Query security-sensitive event logs
- Access SetupAPI device logs
- Retrieve complete device information

### Running Without Admin Rights

The tool will still function with limited access, but:
- Some registry keys may be inaccessible
- Event log queries may fail
- Device information may be incomplete
- A warning will be displayed

### How to Run as Administrator

**Method 1**: Right-click PowerShell
1. Search for "PowerShell" in Start Menu
2. Right-click "Windows PowerShell"
3. Select "Run as Administrator"
4. Navigate to script and run

**Method 2**: Command Line
```powershell
Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList "-File 'C:\Path\To\usb_device_log.ps1'"
```

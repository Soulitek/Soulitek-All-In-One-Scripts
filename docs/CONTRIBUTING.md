## üìù Coding Standards

### PowerShell Best Practices

#### 1. Script Structure
```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Brief description

.DESCRIPTION
    Detailed description

.PARAMETER ParamName
    Parameter description

.EXAMPLE
    Example usage

.NOTES
    Author, version, etc.
#>

[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [string]$RequiredParam
)

# Functions here
function Verb-Noun {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param()
    
    # Implementation
}

# Main execution
```

#### 2. Naming Conventions
- **Functions:** Use approved PowerShell verbs (Get, Set, New, Remove, etc.)
- **Variables:** Use camelCase for local, PascalCase for script scope
- **Parameters:** Use PascalCase
- **Constants:** Use UPPER_CASE

```powershell
# Good
$script:LogFolder = "..."
$localVariable = "..."
[Parameter()]$InputPath

# Avoid
$log_folder = "..."
$LOCALVAR = "..."
```

#### 3. Error Handling
Always use try/catch for operations that might fail:

```powershell
try {
    $result = Get-SomeData -Path $Path -ErrorAction Stop
}
catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to get data: $_"
    Write-Log "Error details: $($_.Exception.Message)" -Level ERROR
    throw
}
finally {
    # Cleanup if needed
}
```

#### 4. Logging
Use the logging infrastructure:

```powershell
Write-Log "Starting operation" -Level INFO
Write-Verbose "Detailed step information"
Write-Warning "This might be a problem"
Write-Error "This is an error"
```

#### 5. Administrator Checks
For scripts requiring admin privileges:

```powershell
if (-not (Test-AdministratorPrivilege)) {
    Write-Host "This script requires Administrator privileges" -ForegroundColor Red
    Write-Host "Please run as Administrator" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    exit 1
}
```

#### 6. Comment-Based Help
Every function must have:

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Short description (one line)

.DESCRIPTION
    Longer description explaining what the function does
    and any important details

.PARAMETER ParamName
    What this parameter does

.EXAMPLE
    Verb-Noun -ParamName "Value"
    
    Description of what this example does

.OUTPUTS
    What type of object is returned

.NOTES
    Additional information, author, version
#>
```

#### 7. WhatIf/Confirm Support
For destructive operations:

```powershell
[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess = $true)]
param()

if ($PSCmdlet.ShouldProcess($Target, $Operation)) {
    # Perform action
}
```

### Code Style

#### Indentation
- Use 4 spaces (not tabs)
- Align opening and closing braces

```powershell
# Good
if ($condition) {
    # Code here
}

# Avoid
if ($condition) 
{
    # Code here
    }
```

#### Line Length
- Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
- Break long lines at logical points

```powershell
# Good
$result = Get-Item -Path $LongPath |
    Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 1MB } |
    Select-Object Name, Length

# Avoid
$result = Get-Item -Path $LongPath | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 1MB } | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime, CreationTime, Extension
```

#### Comments
- Use comments to explain "why", not "what"
- Keep comments up-to-date with code
- Use inline comments sparingly

```powershell
# Good
# Check cache first to avoid expensive API call
$cached = Get-CachedData

# Avoid
# Get cached data
$cached = Get-CachedData
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist

### Automated Testing (Pester)
If adding new functions, include Pester tests:

        It "Should accept valid input" {
            { Function-Name -Param "valid" } | Should -Not -Throw
        }
        
        It "Should reject invalid input" {
            { Function-Name -Param "" } | Should -Throw
        }
    }
    
    Context "Functionality" {
        It "Should return expected output" {
            $result = Function-Name -Param "test"
            $result | Should -BeOfType [PSCustomObject]

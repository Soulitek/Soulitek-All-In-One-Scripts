## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Microsoft Graph Module Not Found"
**Solution**: Install the module
```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Issue: "Insufficient Permissions"
**Cause**: Missing `Organization.Read.All` permission  
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure you're a Global Admin or Global Reader
2. Consent to permissions during first login
3. Contact your tenant admin to grant permissions

### Issue: "Connection Failed"
**Possible Causes**:
- Network connectivity issue
- Firewall blocking port 443
- Proxy configuration required
- Browser authentication cancelled

**Solution**: 
- Check internet connection
- Verify firewall allows HTTPS to graph.microsoft.com
- Complete authentication in browser

### Issue: "Teams Webhook Failed"
**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid webhook URL
- Webhook was deleted
- Channel was deleted
- Network issue

**Solution**:
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Recreate webhook in Teams
- Test with simple message first

### Issue: "No Expiration Dates Shown"
**Note**: Microsoft 365 subscriptions retrieved via `Get-MgSubscribedSku` typically don't include explicit expiration dates. This information is in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center billing section or separate Graph API endpoints for subscriptions.

**Workaround**: The tool focuses on seat capacity alerts, which are equally important indicators of license issues.

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Handled
- License subscription names and SKUs
- Seat counts (total, used, available)
- Service plan names
- Tenant ID (non-sensitive identifier)
- No personal user data or PII

### Permissions
- **Organization.Read.All**: Read-only access to organization info
- Does NOT grant access to:
  - User personal data
  - Email content
  - Files or documents
  - Modify operations

### Best Practices
1. Use least-privilege accounts when possible
2. Run script only on trusted machines
3. Secure exported reports (contain business data)
4. Don't share webhook URLs publicly
5. Regularly review who has access to the tool

---

## Automation Ideas

### Scheduled Task Setup

Create a scheduled task to run the script weekly:

```powershell
# Example: Register scheduled task (requires admin)
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -DaysOfWeek Monday -At 8am
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "PowerShell.exe" `
    -Argument "-File C:\Scripts\license_expiration_checker.ps1"
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId "DOMAIN\ServiceAccount" `
    -LogonType ServiceAccount
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "License Check" `
    -Trigger $trigger -Action $action -Principal $principal
```

### Integration with Monitoring Systems

Export CSV data for integration with:
- Power BI dashboards
- SIEM systems
- ITSM platforms
- Custom monitoring solutions

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Expiration Dates**: `Get-MgSubscribedSku` doesn't return explicit expiration dates for most subscriptions. Use Microsoft 365 Admin Center for subscription renewal dates.

2. **Trial Licenses**: Trial licenses may show as active but have hidden expiration dates.

3. **Add-on Licenses**: Some add-on licenses may not appear separately if bundled.

4. **Real-time Sync**: License data may have a small delay (typically < 5 minutes) from actual assignment changes.

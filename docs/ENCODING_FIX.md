# Encoding Issues Fix - Remote Support Toolkit

## Issue Summary

When launching the Remote Support Toolkit from the GUI launcher, two issues were discovered:

1. **Terminal closing immediately** - The PowerShell window would close before the user could interact with it
2. **Parser error on line 825** - Unicode characters were causing encoding/parsing errors

## Error Message

```
At C:\Users\Eitan\Soulitek-All-In-One-Scripts\scripts\remote_support_toolkit.ps1:825 char:43
+     Write-Host "ג" System Information (OS, CPU, RAM, Serial)" -Foreg ...
+                                           ~
Missing argument in parameter list.
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing `-NoExit` Flag
The launcher was starting PowerShell windows without the `-NoExit` parameter, causing them to close immediately after execution or if an error occurred.

### 2. Unicode Character Encoding Issues
The script contained Unicode characters that were being misinterpreted:
- Checkmark character `✓` (U+2713) was appearing as Hebrew character `ג` on some systems
- Bullet point character `•` (U+2022) could cause similar issues

These encoding problems occur due to:
- Different PowerShell console encodings
- Regional/locale settings
- File encoding mismatches

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Added `-NoExit` Flag to Launcher

**File:** `launcher/SouliTEK-Launcher.ps1`  
**Line:** 139

**Before:**
```powershell
$arguments = "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"$scriptPath`""
```

**After:**
```powershell
$arguments = "-NoExit -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"$scriptPath`""
```

**Result:** PowerShell windows now remain open for user interaction and error visibility.

---

### Fix 2: Replaced Unicode Characters with ASCII

**File:** `scripts/remote_support_toolkit.ps1`

#### Checkmarks (Lines 825-832)

**Before:**
```powershell
Write-Host "✓ System Information (OS, CPU, RAM, Serial)" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "✓ Disk Usage (All drives with free space)" -ForegroundColor Gray
# ... etc
```

**After:**
```powershell
Write-Host "[+] System Information (OS, CPU, RAM, Serial)" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "[+] Disk Usage (All drives with free space)" -ForegroundColor Gray
# ... etc
```

#### Bullet Points (Lines 838-842)

**Before:**
```powershell
Write-Host "• Use 'Full Support Package' for remote support" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "• Create ZIP file to email to support team" -ForegroundColor Gray
# ... etc
```

**After:**
```powershell
Write-Host "- Use 'Full Support Package' for remote support" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "- Create ZIP file to email to support team" -ForegroundColor Gray
# ... etc
```

**Result:** All text now uses ASCII-safe characters that work reliably across all systems and encodings.

---

### Fix 3: Cleaned Up Unused Variables

**File:** `scripts/remote_support_toolkit.ps1`  
**Line:** 571

**Before:**
```powershell
$htmlReport = Export-SystemReport -OutputPath $Script:OutputFolder
```

**After:**
```powershell
$null = Export-SystemReport -OutputPath $Script:OutputFolder
```

**Result:** Eliminated linter warning about unused variable.

---

## Testing

After implementing these fixes, the script should now:

1. ✅ Launch properly from the GUI launcher
2. ✅ Keep the PowerShell window open for interaction
3. ✅ Display correctly without parser errors
4. ✅ Work reliably across different system configurations

## Character Reference

### Replaced Characters

| Character | Unicode | Name | Replaced With | Reason |
|-----------|---------|------|---------------|--------|
| ✓ | U+2713 | Check Mark | `[+]` | Encoding issues |
| • | U+2022 | Bullet | `-` | Potential encoding issues |

### Safe Alternatives

For future reference, use these ASCII-safe alternatives in PowerShell scripts:

- **Lists:** Use `-`, `*`, or `>`
- **Status indicators:** Use `[+]`, `[✓]`, `[OK]`, `[DONE]`
- **Errors:** Use `[X]`, `[!]`, `[ERROR]`
- **Info:** Use `[i]`, `[INFO]`, `[NOTE]`

## Prevention

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. **Always save PowerShell scripts with UTF-8 with BOM encoding**
2. **Test scripts on multiple systems with different locales**
3. **Use ASCII characters for symbols when possible**
4. **Use `-NoExit` flag when launching scripts that require user interaction**
5. **Add proper error handling to catch encoding issues**

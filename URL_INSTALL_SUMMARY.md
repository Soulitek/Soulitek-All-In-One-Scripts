## 🚀 Next Steps (IMPORTANT)

### Step 1: Verify Repository Name

Your installer is configured for: `Soulitek/Soulitek-AIO`

**Check your actual repo name:**
```powershell
git remote -v
```

If different, update line 36 in `Install-SouliTEK.ps1`:
```powershell
$RepoName = "YOUR-ACTUAL-REPO-NAME"
```

### Step 2: Commit & Push to GitHub

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Add URL-based quick installer"
git push origin main
```

**⚠️ Critical:** The `Install-SouliTEK.ps1` file MUST be in the root of your repository and pushed to GitHub for the URL installation to work!

### Step 3: Test It

On any PC, open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soulitek/Soulitek-AIO/main/Install-SouliTEK.ps1 | iex
```

Verify:
- ✅ Downloads successfully
- ✅ Installs to C:\SouliTEK
- ✅ Desktop shortcut created
- ✅ GUI launches
- ✅ All tools work

### Step 4: Create Short URL (Optional)

Make it easier to remember:

**Using bit.ly:**
1. Go to https://bit.ly
2. Paste: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soulitek/Soulitek-AIO/main/Install-SouliTEK.ps1`
3. Custom name: `soulitek-install`
4. Result: Users can run: `iwr -useb bit.ly/soulitek-install | iex`
